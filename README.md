# freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms & Date Structures Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the required projects for the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification

## Projects
- Project 1: Build a Cash Register
    A web-based cash register application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This projects simulates the functionality of a real cash register: it calculates the correct change to return for a given transaction, based on the cash in the drawer. The user enters the purchase price, cash received, and the current state of the cash drawer, and the app outputs whether exact change can be provided and the denominations to be returned. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as algorithms, data structures, user input validation, and DOM manipulation.

  Project 2: Build an RPG Creature Search
    An interactive web app that allows users to search for and view information about various RPG creatures. For this project, I only created 2 creatures. Built with HTML, CSS, and JacaScript, this project features a dynamic search bar where users can enter a creature's name or ID to retrieve its details, including stats and descriptions. The app demonstrates JavaScript fundamentals like fetching and displaying data, event handling, and updating the DOM, while providing a fun, game-inspired interface.
  
- Project 3: Build a Palindrome
    A simple web app that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome-meaning it reads the same forward and backward. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app lets users input text and instantly see if it qualifies as a palindrome, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. This project highlights JavaScript skills such as string manipulation, input validation, and interactive DOM updates.
  
- Project 4: Build a Roman Numeral Converter
    A web application that converts numbers between standard Arabic numerals and Roman numerals. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool allows users to enter a number and instantly see its Roman numeral equivalent, or vice versa. The project demonstrates skills in algorithm design, user input handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation, while offering a practical utility for learning about numeral systems.
  
- Project 5: Build a Telephone Number Validator
    A web-based tool that checks if a given input is a valid US telephone number. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to enter a phone number and instantly verifies based on standard formatting rules. This project demonstrates JavaScript skills in regular expressions, form validation, and real-time feedback through DOM manipulation.
